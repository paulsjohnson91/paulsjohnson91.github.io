			Hi, I'm Paul Johnson. I'm a Software Engineer and have a passion for all things technology! I graduated from Bath University with a 2.1 in Computer Science and Mathematics in June 2014, which included a years placement at GlaxoSmithKline as an SAP consultant. Since then I've worked as a test lead and a test automation engineer on a wide range of technology including mobile, web and embedded software.

		<h2>Education</h2>
		<div class="edutext">
		<p>In September 2010, I started my degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Bath. I had no prior knowledge of programming and was quickly throw head first into Python and Java. I learnt so much there and after 4 years of blood, sweat, tears (and laughs) I graduated with a 2.1 BSc (Hons).</p>
		<p>As my degree was joint computing and maths, the majority of modules I took were in programming, however I did have a chance to do some work with computer graphics and computer vision. I've dabbled with the following: Java, C, C++, Python, C#, OpenGL, Lisp, Visual Basic and MatLab.

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div class="edutext">
			<p><b>Industrial placement</b></p>
			<p>For the third year of my degree, in 2012, I took a placement at GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals. They had recently invested in a complete global SAP environment to replace all the fragmented environments they were left with through various mergers and acquisitions. I was part of the SAP Basis administration team, which is a third line support team responsible for the overall maintenance of the environment, as well as diagnosis of more serious underlying issues. This was my first taste of business technologies and I learnt a great deal from the experience. </p>
			<br/>
			<p><b>Fujitsu</b></p>
			<p>After graduation, I joined Fujitsu, the second oldest IT company in the world, as a test an analyst. I worked for a year on the post office account, one of their biggest retail accounts, creating test plans and performing manual tests in a live test environment. The environment consisted of Java based EPOSS, unix and windows systems and Oracle databases<br>
				After a year I moved into the newly formed rail account working on a mobile ticketing platform. I was quickly promoted into the senior test lead role in charge of 10 test analysts. This work involved writing test documentation, coordinating testing efforts across the team, defect triaging and ensuring that we have maximum test coverage. During this time I was frequently sent to customer sites to act as a lead liason with the company, managing customer expectations and facilitating changes euring roll out. Part of my role included the creation from scratch of a test automation framework, written in Xamarin Test UI, with which I managed to achieve a 60% total test coverage. This was despite automation complications such as bluetooth devices (pinpad and printers).<br>
				Due to my work on mobile test automation, I was able to create a new service line for Fujitsu, as an automation consultant. My role included analysing external companies' current test coverage and writing an automation framework for them which utilised Xamarin Test Cloud to test their mobile applications on hundreds of unique physical devices.</p>
			<br/>
			<p><b>TomTom Sports</b></p>
			<p>
				I joined TomTom in July 2017 in their consumer sports division. The environment consisted of an embedded linux solution (sports watch), iOS/Android applications, a web front end and set of web services. My job was to create a new test automation framework capable of verifying end to end functionality. To do this I set up a test environment of multiple Raspberry Pis each hooked up to watches phones, cnotrolled by a Java/Appium/Cucumber maven project run via Jenkins. Unfortunately the role only lasted 5 months due to the closure of the sports department.

		<h2>Test Automation Experience</h2>
		<div class="edutext">
			<p><b>Mobile Test Automation</b></p>
			<p>
				I've written projects on mobile automation in both Appium (Java) and Calabash (Ruby on Rails). To drive these projects, I've used a mixture of Cucumber and Junit.
			</p>
			<p><b>Xamarin</b></p>
			<p>
				Xamarin Test UI is a cross platform framework for developing test automation suites of any mobile application. The C# based framework works as a key word driven interface similar to Selenium. During my second year as a Graduate at Fujitsu, I created from scratch an automation suite capable of running 60% of the regression tests being run on our weekly application drops. So far this automation suite has saved approximately 6 man days a week of effort, and can be run in a fraction of the time. The Framework was written using Page Object Pattern design which helped minimise false test failures.
				<br/>
				Upon completion of this project, I created multiple Xamarin Test UI frameworks for companies relying on manual testing for their mobile applications. These frameworks were executed in Xamarin Test Cloud, a powerful test platform owned by Microsoft which allowed the testing of hundreds of unique physical devices simultaneously to ensure app functionality for the whole user base, not just on the most popular devices.

		<h2>About This Site</h2>
		<div class="edutext">
		<p>This site has been built from scratch and hosted on <a href="https://www.github.com">github</a>. To save me from reinventing the wheel, I've had help from some excellent JavaScript/Jquery plugins: <a href="https://www.jssor.com">Jssor</a> for image sliders, jquery.popupoverlay from <a href="https://github.com/vast-engineering/jquery-popup-overlay">Vast Engineering</a> for popup information boxes and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">font-awesome</a> for logos and icons.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>The site has been somewhat of a learning opportunity for me as I haven't done real work in web design before this. I've tried to make it as clean and modern as possible, adding in new HTML5 and CSS where I could.
